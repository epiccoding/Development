## Overview and Origin

    > Chainalysis, headquartered in New York City, was founded in 2014

    > The company was originally formed in order to investigate the Mt. Gox cryptocurrency exchange hack and has continued to be used as a way to track crypto currency fraud

    > It would seem that Chanalysis acquires funding through a number of Series F finacing.  As recently as May 12,2022 they received 170 million in financing.  Resulting in a valuation of $8.6 billion (https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/series-f/#:~:text=NEW%20YORK%2C%20May%2012%2C%202022,its%20valuation%20to%20%248.6%20billion.)

    > The primary technologies they rely on are blockchain technologies.  They are pioneers in Web3 analytics.  Managing to scrape and gather an enormous amount of data for their clients.

## Landscape
    > Chainalysis sits firmly in the RegTech industry

    > One of the majory trends of this domain is the consolidation of regulatory practices.  As blockchain technologies continue to grow and develop these RegTech companies are finding opportunities to help government agencies and companies navigate the murky waters of the new web.

    > Some other majory companies in RegTech include:
        > Tessian, a London, UK based company, aimed to reduce compliance risks with human error on email (https://www.tessian.com/)
        > Ascent, a Chicago, IL company, focused on financial compliance software.  (https://www.ascentregtech.com/)
        > PaymentWorks, a Waltham, MA company, focused on fraud detection for B2B payments. (https://www.paymentworks.com/)

## Results
    > Some of the most noteable and newsworthy accomplishments of Chainalysis, so far, include investigating child abuse material, darknet markets like Silk-Road, at least 7 North Korean hackings, among others.

    > From research, it would seem that these companies view their success based on funding and results.  Results in the form of government actions based on their investigations, retrieval of stolen crypto assets, continued work in the regulatory and compliance space.
    > Additionally, the several billions in valuation certainly help lend to their success

    > Comparatively, Chainalysis appears to be the leader in this space, working with the largest number of government agencies, being involved in some of, if not the, biggest landmark cases in the darkweb and randsomware attacks.

## Recommendations
    > A recommendation I would make for Chainalysis continued success would be to more aggressively work towards marketing their products at large banks.  As the large banks continue to explore crypto and NFT options they will need a regulatory partner in this space.  There could be room to grow even further.

    > I can tell you from within my own bank the conversation around cryptocurrencies get more frequent by the day.  The understanding in this space is extremely limited and has a lot of potential for misstep.  It would make sense for one of the pioneers in fraud/investigation solutions to get involved in helping these large firms setup approriate safeguards to ensure their clients and businesses are protected from bad actors.

    > The can continue to use the technologies they already developed and their custom built APIs to allow for easy deployment of their compliance and regulatory tools.  This will allow for the saving of time and money from Chainalysis perspective and potential revenue streams in addition to their continued Series financing.
