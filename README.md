# Bootcamp
My name is Eli, I'm currently a business analyst for PNC Bank.  I am a tech enthusiast and excited to continue learning more about the FinTech environment.

I have experience in banking and investments through my 4 years as a licensed financial specialist and 5 years as a bank relationship manager.

My goals are to continue advancing within the business analytics space I currently am in.  There is a gap in my knowledge around Data Science so I hope to close that gap with this class.
