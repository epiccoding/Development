## About Me
---
My name is Eli, I'm currently a business analyst with PNC Bank.  I am a tech enthusiast and excited to continue learning more about the FinTech environment.

I have experience in banking and investments through my 4 years as a licensed financial specialist and 5 years as a bank relationship manager.

My goals are to continue advancing within the business analytics space and the whole data community.  This class has been tremendously helpful in providing many of the foundational skills I needed to feel confident in the tools I use daily.
